- "I worked with a client who had this 'comprehensive' dashboard"
- Blinded here for confidentiality...but incredibly close to the actual design
- "18 filters, 6 tabs, every possible view, nearly zero adoption"
- The client was frustrated bc they had spent months building this thing, but no one used it
- I had some immediate thoughts, but being a behavioral scientist, I wanted to validate this
    1. So that the client's time and efforts weren't wasted
    2. And so I could show them data to back up my claims and explain why these weren't just subjective issues

:::

::: {.notes}
- 1 minute
- "Start with why - what question does this dashboard answer?"
- [CLICK] "10 word rule"
- Why this is important - most devs think they do this, but telemetry says otherwise. Most jump straight to filters.
- But as devs and data scientists, we're not the best at this. We think we know what users want...and if we're not sure, we just add more filters/options
- But this is exactly what leads to cognitive overload
- `bid_interpret` helps you clarify purpose, user needs, and data story...and if you don't know any of those elements, it prompts you to think about them (which might be a good time to pause and actually chat with your users or client)
- On the back end, it's creating an object that can be used later in the process to make smart suggestions for your specific users
