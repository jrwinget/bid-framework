- Ever open a dashboard with 18 filters across 6 separate tabs...and try to figure out where to even start?
- I mean, that's a lot of data and different ways slicing it to get a full understanding of what's going on...so what do you do?
- That is...if you haven't made your career out of exploring data sets like most executives making decisions...what do you do?
- [CLICK] Maybe you do something like this monkey....just start clicking randomly hoping something sticks

### Real client. Real dashboard. Real problems.

- 18 filters across 6 tabs
- Every possible data view

**We ran telemetry for 30 days...**
:::

::: {.notes}
- 45 seconds
- I worked with a client who had this 'comprehensive' dashboard
- Blinded here for confidentiality...but incredibly close to the actual design
- 18 filters, 6 tabs, every possible view, nearly zero adoption
- Why this matters: This represents thousands of developer hours and client budget wasted on technically perfect but psychologically broken software
- The client was frustrated bc they had spent months building this thing, but no one used it
- As developers, we can relate...we've all built features nobody uses
- But here's why this matters more than frustration:
    1. Technical debt from unused complexity compounds over time
    2. User abandonment patterns replicate across similar projects
    3. Without data-driven insights, we keep making the same UX mistakes
- [CLICK] So we ran telemetry for 30 days...
- This data changed everything about how we approached the dashboard design

- Behavioral science studies how people think, feel, and act...often in the context of decision making
- Surprise...we're not rational...but we are still predictable and fairly consistent when we pay attention to the right drivers
- Let me show you a classic example that mirrors our dashboard problem...Sheena Iyengar & Mark Lepper’s famous jam study at Columbia
- They studied people in the field at a fancy grocery store...think Whole Foods or Trader Joe's
- These shoppers walked by a display stand with either 24 jams...(extensive choice condition)...or 6 jams (limited choice condition)
- More choice drew people in...60% stopped at the big display vs. 40% at the small one
- But fewer choices drove action...nearly 30% bought jam after the 6-jam booth, compared to only 3% after the 24-jam booth
- More choice attracted browsers...but paralyzed buyers
- So what do we learn from this?
    - Too many options look appealing but kill follow-through...exactly what happens with dashboards overloaded with filters

**If you can't explain your dashboard's purpose in 10 words,<br>

:::

::: {.notes}
- 1 minute
- "Start with why - what question does this dashboard answer?"
- [CLICK] "10 word rule"
- Why this matters for your daily work: Clear purpose drives every technical decision you make
- Most devs think they do this, but telemetry says otherwise. We jump straight to technical implementation
- The cost: Every filter you add without purpose increases cognitive load exponentially
- This isn't just UX theory - it's engineering efficiency. When you clarify purpose first:
    1. You write less code because you know what to exclude
    2. Your data queries are more focused and performant
    3. User testing becomes objective rather than subjective
    4. You can defend design decisions with evidence, not opinions
- `bid_interpret` creates a structured object that feeds into later stages, making behavioral science actionable in your R workflow
- Think of it as writing better requirements that actually connect to user psychology

- Notice finds the concepts behind the friction points
- Why this stage matters for developers...It turns user complaints into actionable engineering insights
- Look at this heatmap...14 filters basically going unused...4 are completely ignored
- This isn't just usage data...it's technical debt visualization
- What this means for your codebase:
    1. Those unused filters are maintenance overhead with zero ROI
    2. Database queries could be running for features nobody touches
    3. UI complexity is slowing rendering times without value
    4. Future feature requests will compound these problems over time
- `bid_notice` auto-suggests behavioral theories to explain patterns...or power users can override them with specific concepts
- This transforms "users don't like it" into "choice overload is killing task completion"
- Now you have a specific problem to solve with code

- Why these metrics matter for your engineering career:
    1. 82% reduction in time to insight = users find value faster = better adoption metrics for your projects
    2. 143% improvement in task completion = fewer support tickets = less maintenance overhead
    3. These improvements compound: happy users request thoughtful features, not band-aid fixes
- "This works across industries" - the psychological principles are universal, but implementation adapts to your specific R/Shiny tech stack
- Bottom line: Better user psychology = better engineering outcomes = more impactful projects in your portfolio
