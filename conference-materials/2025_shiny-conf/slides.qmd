## The Problem {.center background-color="#4682B4"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .nonincremental width="60%"}
<h3>Ever felt like this?</h3>

- Endless dropdown menus
- Overwhelming complexity
- Users disengaged
- Delayed decision-making
- "Dashboard rot"

**Opening Hook**: Begin with energy! Make eye contact across the room.

- Start by acknowledging the shared pain point everyone recognizes
- Emphasize the emotional response users have when facing cluttered dashboards
- Mention that this is costing organizations real money through delayed decisions
- "Dashboard rot" = dashboards that get built but never used
- Ask for a show of hands: "How many of you have abandoned using a dashboard because it was too complex?" (engage audience early)

**Transition to Solution**: Shift to a hopeful, inspiring tone here.

- The central thesis of our talk: storytelling vs. data dumping
- Introduce SoundPulse as our case study - they're a composite client...competitor of Spotify
- Their market research team needed to present competitor analysis to executives
- Emphasize that this shift is both attitudinal and technical
- Preview: "We'll show you exactly how this transformation works using real code examples"
- When the GIF appears, pause briefly - people will laugh at the "drowning in paper" visual

::: {.notes}
**Show Impact**: Build up intuition of annoyance/frustration using "before" dashboard.

- Walk through the key issues with the "before" dashboard:
  * "Look at all those filters - users had to make decisions before seeing ANY data"
  * 8 tabs of dense data tables...need to know what you want to figure out in advance
  * "No guidance on where to start - cognitive overload from the beginning"
  * No one wants to use a dashboard like this...and no one will...UIs like this are a major contributor to dashboard rot

1. **Notice** the Problem
2. **Interpret** the User's Need

4. **Anticipate** User Behavior
5. **Validate** & Empower the User
:::

::: {.notes}
**Framework Introduction**: Slow down here - this is the core methodology.

- The 5 stages form an acronym: NISAV (pronounced "knee-sav")
- Each stage builds on psychological principles but translates to practical actions
- Emphasize this isn't just theory - it's a practical workflow for developers
- Preview: "We'll walk through each stage with SoundPulse's case study"
- Mention these are iterative, not strictly linear - you can revisit earlier stages
- Personal anecdote: "We developed this framework after seeing the same patterns of dashboard failure across industries"
:::

## Where BID Fits In {background-color="#F0F0F0"}

::: {.nonincremental}
- Builds on established UX heuristics and theories
- Incorporates data storytelling frameworks
- Systematically integrates cognitive bias mitigation
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis (UX, data viz, behavioral economics)
- Stage-based process rather than heuristic lists
- Specifically tailored for analytics dashboards
:::

::: {.notes}
**Context Setting**: Position the framework within the broader field.

- Acknowledge that this builds on existing work - "We're standing on the shoulders of giants"
- Emphasize the unique integration of disciplines - behavioral economics + UX + data viz
- Key difference from other approaches: process-oriented vs. checklist approach
- "What makes BID different is that it's specifically designed for analytics dashboards"
- This is important context before diving into the stages in detail
- Quickly mention some influences: "Edward Tufte's data visualization principles, Nielsen's heuristics, and Kahneman's work on cognitive biases"

## SoundPulse Case Study: BID Stages 1-3 {background-color="#F9F9F9"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Stage 1: Notice**
  * Complex filtering overwhelmed users (Cognitive Load)
  * 72% users reported confusion (Hick's Law)

- **Stage 2: Interpret**
  * Intuitive visualizations (Processing Fluency)
  * Clearer key insights (Data Storytelling)
:::

**Case Study Setup**: Establish context for upcoming code examples.

- "Let's see how we assessed some of the challenges SoundPulse faced and how we applied the first 3 stages of the BID framework to address them"
- For Stage 1 (Notice): "They identified how filtering complexity was causing cognitive overload"
- For Stage 2 (Interpret): "They discovered users needed to process key metrics instantly"
- For Stage 3 (Structure): "They needed to group related elements and establish clear visual hierarchy"
- "Now let's look at how we implemented these principles using {reactable}..."

::: {.notes}
**Basic Implementation**: Start with the foundational elements.

- "Let's break down the simplest implementation of BID principles in reactable"
- **WOW MOMENT #1**: "The groupBy parameter does double duty here - it addresses cognitive load from Stage 1 while creating visual hierarchy for Stage 3"
- "Color coding isn't just for aesthetics - it directly implements processing fluency from Stage 2"
- "Notice how the conditional styling creates instant visual cues for good and concerning metrics"
- "This simple implementation already reduces cognitive load and enhances processing - but we can do more"
- Transition: "Now let's add more advanced features to handle Stage 3 principles..."
:::

## Implementation Demo: {reactable} Advanced {background-color="#F9F9F9"}

  # Stage 3: Principle of Proximity - Group related elements visually
  columnGroups = list(
    colGroup(name = "System 1 - Quick Insights", 
             columns = c("Metric1", "Metric2")),
    colGroup(name = "System 2 - Detailed Analysis",

      style = "padding: 1rem",
      reactable(detailed_data, outlined = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
    )
  }
)
```

::: {.notes}
**Advanced Features**: Highlight sophisticated techniques.

- "Now we're implementing more advanced BID principles with reactable"
- **WOW MOMENT #2**: "The columnGroups feature implements Dual-Processing Theory by separating quick insights (System 1) from detailed analysis (System 2)"
- "The create_bar_chart_cell function creates custom HTML for enhanced bar charts with tooltips"
- **WOW MOMENT #3**: "Progressive disclosure with the details parameter is one of the most powerful cognitive load reduction techniques - users only see the details when they need them"
- "This nested reactable implementation lets users drill down into detailed data without being overwhelmed"
- "All of these features work together to create a dashboard that respects how humans actually process information"
- Ask audience: "How many of you have used columnGroups or details in reactable?" (interactive moment)
- Transition: "Now let's see how these principles look in the final implementation..."

**Gauge Charts**: Start with visually impactful elements.

- "Let's start with gauge charts that implement processing fluency principles from Stage 2"
- **WOW MOMENT #5**: "The e_gauge function creates visually intuitive displays that are instantly comprehensible"
- "Notice how we're customizing the gauge to eliminate unnecessary elements like the pointer"
- "The color gradient visually reinforces the value - showing progress as filled area"
- "Custom tooltips provide additional context to mitigate confirmation bias from Stage 4"
- "This function encapsulates a reusable pattern that we can apply consistently across metrics"

```

::: {.notes}
**Reference Lines**: Highlight the Anchoring Effect implementation.

- "This code directly implements the Anchoring Effect principle from Stage 4"
- **WOW MOMENT #6**: "The e_mark_line feature provides visual reference points that anchor interpretation"
- "Without these reference lines, values like 65% or 45% have no context - are they good or bad?"
- "By providing benchmarks, we're giving users appropriate anchors for comparison"
- "Notice the styling choices - orange dashed line creates visual distinction from the data"
- "The tooltip provides additional context about the benchmark source"
- "This simple addition dramatically improves how users interpret the data"
- Transition: "Now let's look at our most sophisticated implementation - the framing toggle..."

**Framing Effect**: Emphasize psychological impact.

- "This slide demonstrates the power of framing in action - same exact data, completely different psychological impact"
- "Progress framing creates motivation and highlights achievement - 'We're 65% there!'"
- "Gap framing creates urgency and focuses on what remains to be done - '35% still to go!'"
- "This psychological principle has been demonstrated in countless studies"
- "Present a 90% survival rate vs. a 10% mortality rate - people react completely differently"
- "At SoundPulse, this had real organizational impact"
    - Marketing team preferred progress framing for stakeholder presentations, while product teams found gap framing more actionable for development priorities.
- "Marketing needed to show progress to build confidence with stakeholders"
- "Product teams needed to focus on gaps to prioritize development resources"
- "The toggle feature meant both teams could use the same dashboard for different purposes"
- "This is why understanding psychological principles is so powerful for dashboard design"
- Interactive moment: "Think about your own dashboards - are you framing data in a way that drives the right decisions?"
- Transition: "Now let's talk about how we're making these principles accessible to every developer..."

**Results Summary**: Emphasize concrete benefits.

- These outcomes reflect consistent feedback across client organizations that have embraced our framework. The qualitative data tells a compelling story:
  * (PAUSE) Teams are making decisions with much greater speed and confidence
  * (PAUSE) Users are discovering more actionable insights in each session
  * (PAUSE) And perhaps most telling—stakeholders have shifted from being skeptical to becoming advocates
- We're currently building telemetry into our dashboards to gather more precise measurements...but the message from our users is already clear: this framework is changing how teams interact with their data
- When the testimonial appears: "This kind of transformation is what BID is all about"
- "Remember, this wasn't just visual changes - this was a fundamental shift in how our users...and developers...approached the dashboard"
:::

  * "Does this work for technical audiences?" → "Absolutely, technical users appreciate clarity too"
  * "How long does implementation take?" → "Start small - even one principle makes a difference"
- "Don't forget to follow us on LinkedIn/GitHub for updates on {bidux} development"
