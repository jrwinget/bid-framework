    note: |
      Another author footnote, this is a very long footnote and it should be a really long footnote. But this footnote is not yet sufficiently long enough to make two lines of footnote text.

# Abstract 
- Define the Behavioral Insight Design (BID) framework. 
- Highlight theoretical foundations (cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, dual-process theories). 
- Emphasize its operationalization of psychological theory into practical design principles. 
- State its interdisciplinary value between psychology and UX/HCI. 

# Introduction 
- Motivation: increased cognitive demands in data-rich environments. 
- Identify the gap: lack of structured psychological frameworks in UX/HCI. 
- Introduce BID as a synthesis of established psychological theories. 

# Theoretical Background 
Summarize foundational theories relevant to BID: 
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) 
- Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman & Tversky) 
- Cognitive Biases (Anchoring, Framing, Confirmation Bias) 
- Information Processing and Visual Perception (Gestalt principles, Tufte) 
- Peak–End Rule & Aesthetic–Usability Effect (Dion et al., 1972; Norman, 2002) 

# The Behavioral Insight Design (BID) Framework 
Outline BID’s 5-stage model explicitly mapping psychological theories to each: 
- Stage 1: Notice (Cognitive Load, Hick’s Law, Visual Hierarchy) 
- Stage 2: Interpret (Data Storytelling, Processing Fluency, Emotional Framing) 
- Stage 3: Structure (Gestalt Principles, Dual-Processing, Default Effects) 
- Stage 4: Anticipate (Anchoring, Framing, Confirmation Bias, Risk Perception) 
- Stage 5: Validate & Empower (Peak–End Rule, Beautiful-is-Good, Cooperation & Coordination) 

# Discussion: Theoretical Implications & Innovations 
- How BID operationalizes psychological concepts into UX steps. 
- Novelty in explicitly anticipating and mitigating biases within design phases. 
- Potential as a tool for cognitive/behavioral psychology experimentation. 

# Future Directions 
- Propose empirical studies testing BID-derived predictions. 
- Suggest deeper investigations into psychological mechanisms influencing dashboard efficacy (e.g., cognitive load, memory retention, decision accuracy). 

# Conclusion
- Restate BID’s theoretical contribution as a coherent synthesis of psychology into design methodology.
