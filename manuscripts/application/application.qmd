      Another author footnote, this is a very long footnote and it should be a really long footnote. But this footnote is not yet sufficiently long enough to make two lines of footnote text.

# Abstract 
- Briefly introduce the BID framework. 
- Emphasize practical applications: structured steps designers/developers can directly adopt. 
- Highlight UX advantages: reduced cognitive friction, enhanced insight extraction, increased user satisfaction. 

# Introduction 
- Context: growing industry demand for actionable UX methodologies incorporating psychological insights. 
- State the need for a clear, structured UX process grounded in cognitive science and behavioral insights. 
- Introduce BID as a practical UX-oriented framework designed explicitly for interactive data applications. 

# Literature Review: Practical UX Context 
- Briefly overview existing UX frameworks (Design with Intent, Persuasive Systems Design, Cognitive Fit Theory, data storytelling). 
- Identify practical limitations or gaps in existing methods (e.g., fragmented approaches, lack of a structured end-to-end method). 
- Position BID clearly within the UX literature as an integrated solution, drawing explicitly on the psychological theories outlined in the theoretical paper. 

# Overview of Behavioral Insight Design (BID) Framework
- Short summary of each stage tailored specifically for UX practitioners: 
    - Notice user friction 
    - Interpret user insights 
    - Structure dashboard information 
    - Anticipate cognitive biases 
    - Validate and empower users through UX design 

# Application of the BID Framework in Practice 
For each stage, include: 
1. Stage 1: Notice User Friction 
    - Practical methods: heuristic evaluations, friction point audits, user interviews. 
    - UX tools recommended: usability testing, cognitive walkthroughs. 
1. Stage 2: Interpret User Insights 
    - Methods: data storytelling best practices, storyboard creation, defining user journeys. 
    - Highlight practical tips for narrative clarity and data reduction. 
1. Stage 3: Structure Dashboard Information 
    - Guidelines: visual hierarchy, defaults, Gestalt grouping. 
    - Practical UX examples: optimal layouts, recommended widgets/components, interactivity levels. 
1. Stage 4: Anticipate Cognitive Biases 
    - Explicit bias mitigation techniques: visual framing, scenario toggles, debiasing cues. 
    - Provide examples of bias-aware visual designs (e.g., anchoring reduction through careful baseline selection, reframing of KPIs). 
1. Stage 5: Validate and Empower Users 
    - Recommendations: summarize key insights, ensure aesthetic appeal, implement collaborative UX features. 
    - UX best practices: design checklists for peak-end experiences, validation via usability testing. 

# Case Study: Implementation of BID Framework 
- Showcase a detailed, practical example (ideally using a real or hypothetical Shiny dashboard case). 
- Highlight how BID practically influenced UX design choices at each stage. 
- Discuss measurable UX outcomes: improved usability, increased user comprehension/confidence, evidence from user testing, or satisfaction scores. 

# Discussion: UX Impact & Practical Adoption 
- Summarize how BID fills UX gaps and provides actionable guidance. 
- Highlight benefits specifically for dashboard or interactive data visualization designers. 
- Discuss practitioner-oriented implications: ease of adoption, required UX skill levels, integration into agile UX workflows.

# Future UX Research and Extensions
- Suggest practical UX studies to empirically validate BID framework effectiveness. 
- Outline potential UX-focused extensions: accessibility design, inclusive UX practices, AI-assisted BID integration. 

# Conclusion
- Restate BIDâ€™s value for UX practice: clear, structured, actionable. 
- Encourage UX professionals to adopt and adapt the BID framework in industry settings.
