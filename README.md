# 📘 5-Stage Behavior Insight Design (BID) Framework  
**Understanding & Applying Behavioral Insights for More Effective Application Design**  

---

## 📝 Overview  
The **5-Stage Behavior Insight Design (BID) Framework** is a structured approach for developing intuitive, bias-aware, and user-centered dashboards. Grounded in behavioral science and cognitive psychology, this framework guides developers through **five key stages** to enhance user experience and decision-making:

1️⃣ **Notice** → Identify cognitive friction & usability challenges  
2️⃣ **Interpret** → Understand the core user needs & data story  
3️⃣ **Structure** → Build an intuitive, bias-aware dashboard layout  
4️⃣ **Anticipate** → Consider cognitive biases & decision-making patterns  
5️⃣ **Validate** → Ensure clarity, confidence, and effective user engagement  

This repository contains all materials related to the BID Framework, including:  
✔ **Manuscripts & Research Papers** 📄  
✔ **Conference Presentations** 🎤  
✔ **Example Implementations in R Shiny** 💻  
✔ **Supplementary Reading & References** 📚
